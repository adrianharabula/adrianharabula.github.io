title: Running linux in your home routers
---

It was a pretty nice realization when I found out you can install linux on your router.

Found out by reading a router review, saying that it supports openwrt and the guy installed it and was using the machine as a home file server. 

Another awesome realization was when it hit me that they must have a CPU and Ram.

And storage, and that the linux itself runs on 4mb flash chip! 

Going even further, they also have gpio pins.

Popular routers already have images ready to flash.

You can change their flash, so you get 8mb, 16mb or more of available memory. You can solder more RAM!!! 

How this sounds? 

Now let's get to the basics and boot a Linux image on our testing router.

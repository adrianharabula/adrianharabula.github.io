At the present time I spend 110% of my time with:
*  docker & docker compose & docker stack
*  automation of server provisioning
*  moving current deployments to kubernetes & docker swarm clusters
*  building pipelines in GitLab to automate deployments

No other public projects ongoing, except this blog, but some will come after deep diving the points above. Access to partial apps & very early projects can be given on request, by sending an email to adrian.harabula@gmail.com with title "Request GitLab access."

In real life, if I refuse an invitation or a coffee meeting, don't take it personally as I refuse about 90% of the invitations and it means that I'm working on the things above. Hint: Chances for a meetup greatly increase if the meeting is about points above. But it's not a rule and I'd rather discuss new/different/unrelated subjects on first occasion.

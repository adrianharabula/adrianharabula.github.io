From the cloudflare side, add desired subdomain you want to map.

![add subdomain](/img/dynamic-dns-with-ddclient-and-cloudflare/cloudflare_add_subdomain.png)

Put a dummy IP address (127.0.0.1), deactivate orange cloud and click Add Record.

Next, from [My profile](https://www.cloudflare.com/a/profile) page get Global API Key.

![get global api key](/img/dynamic-dns-with-ddclient-and-cloudflare/cloudflare_get_global_api_key.png)

On a machine with a dynamic public ip, install ddclient with:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ddclient libjson-any-perl
```
Update `/etc/default/ddclient`:  
Check for __run\_daemon="true"__ and update __daemon\_interval__ to preferred value, default is 300 seconds.
```
# Configuration for ddclient scripts
# generated from debconf on Fri 24 Nov 21:37:56 EET 2017
#
# /etc/default/ddclient

# Set to "true" if ddclient should be run every time DHCP client ('dhclient'
# from package isc-dhcp-client) updates the systems IP address.
run_dhclient="false"

# Set to "true" if ddclient should be run every time a new ppp connection is
# established. This might be useful, if you are using dial-on-demand.
run_ipup="false"

# Set to "true" if ddclient should run in daemon mode
# If this is changed to true, run_ipup and run_dhclient must be set to false.
run_daemon="true"

# Set the time interval between the updates of the dynamic DNS name in seconds.
# This option only takes effect if the ddclient runs in daemon mode.
daemon_interval="60"
```

Insert valid email, API Key and update the subdomains you want to update in `/etc/ddclient.conf`:  
```
# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
#
# /etc/ddclient.conf

##
### CloudFlare config
###

ssl=yes
use=web, web=dyndns
protocol=cloudflare,
server=www.cloudflare.com
login=INSERT_CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL
password=INSERT_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN

# set domain and subdomain to update
zone=domain1.com
sub1.domain1.com

# OPTIONAL
# sub2.domain1.com

# OPTIONAL
# zone=domain2.com
# sub1.domain2.com
```

Test current config with:
```bash
sudo ddclient -daemon=0 -debug -verbose -noquiet
```

Restart ddclient service:
```
sudo service ddclient restart
```

Now ddclient is up and running as is checking for DNS updates every 60 seconds.

Check service status with:
```bash
sudo service ddclient start
```

These instructions have been tested on ubuntu 16.04 and raspberry pi with raspbian stretch.

Future work:
 * pack the service as a docker container, run service from a single command.

Just found out you can install Linux. Grabbed some old routers and started hacking.

There are many [variants](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-choose-the-best-firmware-to-supercharge-your-wi-1694982764), went with [OpenWrt](//openwrt.org) for this one.

You can hack your router and gain total control of your network.

The distro running is [OpenWrt](//openwrt.org), see [suported devices list](//wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start).

There are also variants, see more info [here](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-choose-the-best-firmware-to-supercharge-your-wi-1694982764).

Welcome to this journal. It is not written especially for the public, but you can view it as a personal journal regarding my life and what I have learned along the way.

I had a wonderful chance here to be honest with myself and review some of my life's moments, thoughts and ideas.

This is in fact that a blog about the experiments that I made.  Experiments who took from 30 days to 18 months. As Peter Drucker says. Experiments and don't quit too often.

30 days are too less for a change.  But 6 months is more accurate.  Even so, sometimes 18months+ is needed.  See my finances.  If I didn't had the time to wait,  the I couldn't experiment in this area,  because results don't come overnight.
